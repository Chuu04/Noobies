          <h3>Weird Horse Facts</h3>
          <p>
            Horses cannot burp or vomit.
            They have a very strong muscle ring called the cardiac sphincter at the entrance to their stomachs. This structure makes sure any food that enters the stomach cannot exit. Vomiting is a protection system; it rids the stomach of possible food-related intolerances, such as poisons, bacteria, and viral infections. It is thought then that this inability in horses to vomit has another purpose. When horses run, their intestines hammer on their stomach, causing pressure to build up. If their sphincter valve opened under pressure, horses would vomit every time they ran. In the wild, where horses are prey, if the horse vomited, eventually, the predator would catch its prey.

          <h3>Weird Human Body Facts</h3>
          <p>
            Inside our intestines, there resides a population of worms known as intestinal parasites. These parasites can vary in size, with some reaching several inches in length. While they are typically harmless in small numbers, the thought of sharing our bodies with these organisms can be quite creepy.
            Remember, while the fact may seem creepy, they are all natural processes that occur within our bodies. Embracing our biological quirks and understanding the complexities of our existence can help us appreciate the marvels of the human body, even if they occasionally give us the shivers.

        But with this gift of intellect comes challenges. The cacophony of thoughts and ideas that dance within your mind can sometimes lead to a sense of detachment from the world around you. Social norms and small talk may seem trivial in comparison to the grand tapestry of knowledge you strive to unravel.
